# BSc_MathematicalModelsForEconomicApplications
During the last semester of my BSc (February-May 2024), I attended the Mathematical Models for Economic Applications course, held by Professor Sivlia Bortot and Professor Ricardo Alberto Marques Pereira. In this file, you will find functions that I created to solve exercises related to the topics covered in class. The primary goal of these functions is to improve my Python programming skills, as there are already packages that perform the same tasks. Furthermore, I am fully aware that there might be more efficient ways to solve some of the algorithms, but the purpose of these scripts is to solve the course exercises in Python. For any questions or requests for information, please contact me at thomas.demassari@gmail.com

Main topics of the course: 
- Introductory Linear Algebra
- Linear Programming
- Dynamic Models
