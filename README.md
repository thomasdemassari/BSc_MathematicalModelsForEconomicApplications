# BSc_MathematicalModelsForEconomicApplications
During the last semester of my BSc (February-May 2024), I attended the Mathematical Models for Economic Applications course, held by Professor Silvia Bortot and Professor Ricardo Alberto Marques Pereira. In this file, you will find functions that I created to solve exercises related to the topics covered in class. The primary goal of these functions is to improve my Python programming skills while studying for the final exam. Furthermore, I am fully aware that there might be more efficient ways to implement some of the algorithms and more efficient Python functions, but the purpose of these scripts is to solve the course exercises in Python. For any questions or requests for information, please contact me at thomas.demassari@gmail.com   

Main topics of the course:      
- Introductory Linear Algebra           
- Linear Programming (Simplex Algorithm and Knapsack Problem)       
- Dynamic Models (Consensus Dynamics and Linear Dynamic Population Redistribution).
